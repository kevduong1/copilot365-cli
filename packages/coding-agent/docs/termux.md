# Run gcode on Android with Termux

gcode runs on Android through [Termux](https://termux.dev/), a terminal emulator and Linux environment. Text input, file tools, and shell commands are supported. gcode can copy and paste text through the Android clipboard with Termux:API. Clipboard image paste is not supported.

## Before you begin

Install Termux from [GitHub or F-Droid](https://github.com/termux/termux-app#installation). Do not use the deprecated Google Play build.

[Termux:API](https://github.com/termux/termux-api#installation) is optional. Install it only when you want gcode to copy or paste Android clipboard text, or when shell commands need Android device APIs.

## Install gcode

1. Update Termux packages:

   ```bash
   pkg update && pkg upgrade
   ```

2. Install Node.js and Git:

   ```bash
   pkg install nodejs git
   ```

3. Install gcode:

   ```bash
   npm install -g --ignore-scripts gcode
   ```

4. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   gcode --version
   ```

5. Open the folder you want to work in and start gcode:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/working-folder
   gcode
   ```

Continue with the main [Quickstart](quickstart.md#3-choose-a-model) to connect a model and run your first task.

## Access Android shared storage

Termux cannot access shared Android storage until you grant permission. Run this once:

```bash
termux-setup-storage
```

After approval, Android shared storage is available under `/storage/emulated/0` and through the links Termux creates under `~/storage/`.

Only grant this permission when gcode should be able to access those files. Commands and tools running in Termux use the same storage permissions as the Termux process.

## Use clipboard commands

gcode uses `termux-clipboard-set` to copy text and `termux-clipboard-get` for its clipboard-paste shortcut. Shell commands can use both commands directly. Install the Termux:API app and its command-line package:

```bash
pkg install termux-api
```

Verify the integration:

```bash
printf 'gcode clipboard test' | termux-clipboard-set
termux-clipboard-get
```

The second command should print `gcode clipboard test`.

The Termux clipboard API supports text only. gcode's clipboard-paste shortcut inserts that text into the editor but cannot attach clipboard images.

## Add Termux-specific instructions

gcode detects that it is running in Termux, but it cannot infer how you want it to interact with Android. Add only the environment details relevant to your work to `~/.gcode/agent/AGENTS.md`:

````markdown
# Termux environment

- gcode runs in Termux on Android.
- Shared Android storage is under `/storage/emulated/0`.
- Open URLs with `termux-open-url "https://example.com"`.
- Open files with `termux-open <path>`.
- Do not access shared storage unless the task requires it.
````

Run `/reload` after changing the file during an active session.

## Troubleshooting

### Clipboard integration fails

Confirm that you installed both components:

1. The Termux:API Android app from the same source as Termux
2. The `termux-api` command-line package

Then run the clipboard verification commands above outside gcode. If they fail there, fix the Termux:API installation before retrying gcode's copy command.

### Shared storage reports permission denied

Run `termux-setup-storage`, approve the Android permission request, and retry the path under `~/storage/` or `/storage/emulated/0`.

### gcode is not found after installation

Open a new Termux shell and run:

```bash
npm prefix -g
command -v gcode
```

Confirm that the global npm binary directory is on `PATH`, then reinstall gcode if the package is missing.
